1. If the three jobs all have same length 200:
    a. SJF: turnaround - 200, 400, 600 (average 400)
            response - 0, 200, 400 (average 200)
    b. FIFO: same as SJF for jobs of same length arriving at same time

2. Three different job lengths: 100, 200 and 300
    a. SJF: turnaround - 100, 300, 700 (average 366.67)
            response - 0, 100, 300 (average 133.33)
    b. FIFO: It isn't clear what order these jobs arrive in from the question..

3. Another ambiguous question..

4. SJF and FIFO have the same turnaround when the jobs have the same length.

5. SJF has the same response time as RR if the quantum length equals the length of the jobs (which all have the same length)

6. SJF response time increases linearly with job length.

7. Response gets slower as the quantum length increases. Assuming jobs of the same length, and a quantum length equal to the length of the job (L), we get an average response L * (0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + .. N-1) / N = L * ((N-1)(N) / 2) / N = L * (N-1)/2
